# Pothole_Detection
This project demonstrates a pothole detection system. The application uses a deep learning-based object detection model to detect potholes in uploaded road images and provides feedback by highlighting detected potholes with bounding boxes. The app is implemented in Python using Flask, PyTorch and ONNX.
